If you want to autostart an application in Raspbian, just edit the following file;

```~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart```

contents of this file

```
@lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
@xscreensaver -no-splash
@hexchat
```

I added ```@hexchat``` on the bottom to have HexChat IRC client autostarted at logon.
