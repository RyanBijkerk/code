PowerFuse: MSSQL query to gather the application usage as a table compared to the cumbersome PowerFuse Usage Tracker Viewer

To generate a list of all applications, sorted on the application name, you can use the following query.

```
select b.strtitle, count(1)
from
(select distinct a.struser, a.strtitle
from dbo.TBLhistory a
where a.lngappid > 1) b
group by b.strtitle
order by b.strtitle;
```

Example of the result:

```
7-Zip 43
Access 57
Access Management Console 24
ACDSee 19
Acrobat Reader 131
Active Directory Users and Computers 12
Adobe Acrobat Pro 1
Adobe Reader 846
```

If you would like to know which application has the highest usage count, a little adaptation to the query is needed.

```
select b.strtitle, count(1)
from
(select distinct a.struser, a.strtitle
from dbo.TBLhistory a
where a.lngappid > 1) b
group by b.strtitle
order by COUNT(1) desc;
```

Example of the result:

```
Adobe Reader 846
Acrobat Reader 131
Access 57
7-Zip 43
Access Management Console 24
ACDSee 19
Active Directory Users and Computers 12
